FlitReduce: Improving Memory Fabric Performance via End-to-End Network Packet Compression

New technologies in fabrication and packaging have led to an explosion in core counts as time continues. Network-on-Chip (NOC) is a router-based packet switching network that enables an efficient on-chip interconnect between cores. Prior research has shown that, especially for highly parallel workloads, the design and performance of the NoC has a great effect on the overall performance of the system. Our project FlitReduce intends to improve the data transmission efficiency over the NoC by data compression. FlitReduce implements compressors and decompressors on the ends of the NoC to reduce the amount of overall memory traffic and, thus, the communication congestion, improving the NoC performance while imposing little effects on the other components in the network.
